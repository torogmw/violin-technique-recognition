Violin-Technique-Detection
==========================

Real-time Violin Technique detection

This project aims at recognizing both bowing and fingering performing techniques of violin based on audio feature analysis and machine learning methods. Both time domain and frequency domain features are extracted to represent five different playing techniques. We also propose a novel feature to distinguish tremolo from vibrato. For classification, we train a hierarchy of binary SVM classifiers, combined with an unsupervised method. The system is tested on a set of recordings played by several violinists. Statistic results are generated and compared to related approaches.
